# Operating-systems
This repo is created to contain the Operating systems project.

The project is about having a signboard display some announcements and advertisements for some companies and individuals 
to be presented for a specific time depending on their priorities. The program manages scheduling and threads to 
execute and control the changes and change priority as needed in the runtime.
